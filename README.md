Learning and Implementing 
  - Binomial NB: When features are coming from Bernoulli distribution, like we see in Binary Bag of Words
  - Multinomial NB: When features are discrete random values like we see in TF-IDF/BOW
  - Gaussian NB: When features are coming from Gaussian distribution like we see in w2v
